What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

		When you initialize a repository git will then begin to track changes in
		that location. You can commit files and compare them as needed.

		You need to do this because otherise you have no way to version control your
		work in that repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What
value do you think it offers?

		The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository because
		it is where files that will be commited in the next commit are added. This allows you to
		control which files in a working directroy are part of the respository and which are not.

		This can be of value when you have other files in the working directory that you do not
		need to have version control for.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

		I would use the staging area to compare a version of a file against the last commit to ensure
		that there is only the change I expect present. This would help keep the changes to just
		one logical change?
